# Upcoming Movie Trailers

This server-side website displays a list of upcoming movies and their trailers.

## Getting Started

To get this project running on your local machine, you will need to have downloaded the following files:
- media.py
- entertainment_center.py
- fresh_tomatoes.py

Ensure all the above files are in one location.

### Prerequisites

- You should have _python_ running(version used was 2.7).
- A browser
- An internet connection

### Running Upcoming Movie Trailers

Get the website to display by opening the **entertainment_center.py** file and running the python application.
This will make an API call to **themoviedb.org** and generate a _upcoming_movies_ file which will display the content.

### Built With

* **Python** - for the entire server-side application
* **[themoviedb.org](themoviedb.org)** - the movie API source

### Authors

* **Udacity** - Initial project was developed by Udacity for the Full Stack Web Development Nano-Degree course
* **Martin Twum Mensah** - Updated the application with an API call and UI changes

### Acknowledgement

Special thanks to Udacity for helping me to push my skill level further.
